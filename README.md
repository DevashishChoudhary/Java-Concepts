## * Print Statement:-

Java System.out.println() is used to print an argument that is passed to it. The statement can be broken into 3 parts which can be understood separately as:

**System:** It is a final class defined in the java.lang package.

**out:** This is an instance of PrintStream type, which is a public and static member field of the System class.

**println():** As all instances of PrintStream class have a public method println(), hence we can invoke the same on out as well. This is an upgraded version of print(). It prints any argument passed to it and adds a new line to the output. We can assume that System.out represents the Standard Output Stream.

## * Data Types and Concatenation :-

Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. There are two types of data types in Java:

**Primitive data types:** The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.

**Non-primitive data types:** The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

In java, string concatenation forms a new string that is the combination of multiple strings. There are two ways to concat string in java:

  * By + (string concatenation) operator
  * By concat() method
