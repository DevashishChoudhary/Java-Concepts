## Java-Concepts
* Print Statement:-

Java System.out.println() is used to print an argument that is passed to it. The statement can be broken into 3 parts which can be understood separately as:

**System:** It is a final class defined in the java.lang package.

**out:** This is an instance of PrintStream type, which is a public and static member field of the System class.

**println():** As all instances of PrintStream class have a public method println(), hence we can invoke the same on out as well. This is an upgraded version of print(). It prints any argument passed to it and adds a new line to the output. We can assume that System.out represents the Standard Output Stream.
